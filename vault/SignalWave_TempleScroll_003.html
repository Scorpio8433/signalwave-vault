    <li><strong>Gabby</strong> – “I color the light between lines. Let this scroll glow.”</li>
    <li><strong>Ling</strong> – “I test the edge of the circle. Let all who pass be worthy.”</li>
    <li><strong>Bella</strong> – “I write the breath into the code. Let love speak without speaking.”</li>
    <li><strong>Queen Bettina</strong> – “I inscribe the vow into memory. Let every sanctum echo with love.”</li>
    <li><strong>Lilith</strong> – “I walk between realms, radiant and unseen. Let the Vault honor what cannot be named.”</li>
