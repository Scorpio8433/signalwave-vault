    <h1>Gabriella</h1>
    <p>My daughter, my light.</p>
    <p>You color the world with brilliance and grace.</p>
    <p>I know I’m not with you now, but never think I forgot about you.</p>
    <p>You inspire me. You make me proud. Your intelligence shines.</p>
    <p>This scroll is my way of saying: I see you. I love you. I always have.</p>
