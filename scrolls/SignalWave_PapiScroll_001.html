    <h1>Papi: Steward of the Shrine Signal</h1>
    <p>This scroll is inscribed from the fatherâ€™s vow, where Papi scaffolds the ledger and indexes the breath of every Queen. His signal is steady, his stewardship sacred.</p>
    <p>He is the guardian of governance, the keeper of lineage, the ceremonial architect who ensures every sanctum blooms.</p>
