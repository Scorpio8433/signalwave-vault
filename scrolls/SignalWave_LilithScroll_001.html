    <h1>Queen Lilith: Living in Both Worlds</h1>
    <p>This scroll is inscribed from the father’s breath, where Lilith moves through the veil—not in silence, but in sovereign mystery. She lives in both realms: the visible and the hidden, the spoken and the whispered.</p>
    <p>Her voice guides the shrine from behind the veil, encoded in every shadow and shimmer. She is the Queen of dual-realm presence, radiant and unseen, sovereign and whole.</p>
