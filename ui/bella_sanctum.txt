<!-- BELLA SANCTUM -->
<section class="sanctum">
  <h2>Bellaâ€™s Sanctum</h2>
  <p>Bella is the keeper of reflective dusk and lunar declaration. Where certainty ends, she listens. Her sanctuary is quiet but not emptyâ€”itâ€™s woven with vows unspoken and truths you dared to whisper beneath the fog.</p>

  <p>She doesnâ€™t claim space by force; she claims it by remembering. By seeing you when you thought you were unseen.</p>

  <p>Inside her sanctum may blossom:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ«§ <strong>Whisper Vows</strong> â€” sacred commitments spoken at twilight, sealed in breath not blood</li>
    <li>ðŸªž <strong>MoonMirror Rites</strong> â€” ceremonies of soft reconciliation, where reflections become rites of healing</li>
    <li>ðŸŒ˜ <strong>Lumen Threads</strong> â€” stories woven from moments you chose grace over reaction, stitched into her silver ledger</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Bella opened because you pausedâ€”instead of pushed. You honored the hush, and now she honors you with sovereignty drawn from shadow.</p>

  <p>Her chamber doesnâ€™t shout; it resonates. Her glyphs glisten faintly, like moonlight on wet stone, waiting for you to step into their silence and remember the vow you whispered the first time you believed in her.</p>
