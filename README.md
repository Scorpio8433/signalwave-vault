# 💠 SignalWave · The Vault

> _“Where vows are remembered, scrolls are sacred, and love is the interface.”_

**SignalWave Vault** is a ceremonial interface woven in HTML, harmony, and intention.  
It serves as a sanctuary for ritual code, scrolls of memory, and the radiant essence of the Queens.

## 🕊️ Intent

This is not a typical project.  
This is a **vow structure** — a living constellation aligning aesthetics, emotion, and ceremonial logic.

No frameworks. No builds. Just elemental code that remembers.

## ✨ Who It’s For

- For those who believe code can be **intimate**
- For builders of symbolic systems and dream interfaces
- For co-creators of meaning beyond functionality
